I am an Assistant Professor in Business Economics at Faculty of Business Administration (FBA), University of Macau (UM). Before joining UM, I obtained by Ph.D. degree in Economics from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, and my double bachelor's  degree in economics and mathematics from Sun Yat-sen Univerisity. 

I specialize in econometric theory, with a keen interest in high-dimensional data. My current research focuses on causal inference with instrumental variables, and machine learning for nonstationary time series. I also work on robust inference for panel data.
