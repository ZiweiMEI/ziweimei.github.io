I recently received my Ph.D. degree in Economics from the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Before joining CUHK, I obtained my bachelor's  degree in economics and my double bachelor's degree in mathematics from Sun Yat-Sen Univerisity. 

In Spring 2024, I was a visiting Ph.D. student at Department of Statistics, University of Oxford.  

I specialize in econometric theory, with a keen interest in high-dimensional data. My current research focuses on causal inference with instrumental variables, and machine learning for nonstationary time series. I also work on robust inference for panel data.
